Currant is a single-threaded programming language that runs in the browser. It has simple interoperability with JavaScript and can be easily embedded into a webpage.

Documentation (still being worked on) is accessible [here](currant.netlify.app).

As you can maybe tell, this README is also still being worked on and will be finished once the language has been fully documented.
